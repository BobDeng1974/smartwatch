# smartwatch

Code for a smartwatch project.

Currently contains a *lot* of code from Adafruit, found [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino).

Requires the arm-none-eabi toolchain, and [Adafruit's nrfutil](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_nrfutil). Makefile can build `all`, `clean`, or `upload`.

More to come.
